This page addresses misinformation and frequent criticisms about Andrew Yang
and his policies. We put forth rebuttals and clarifications that we try to
support with facts and statistics. Rather than spread knee-jerk reactions,
myths, and misrepresentation of ideas &mdash; let's delve deeper, and think harder.




## Andrew Yang


### "Andrew Yang is a one-policy candidate."

Yang has [**over 100 policies**][policies] on his website. Each policy has its
own page containing background context, statistics, list of problems identified
to be solved, stated goals, and action plan as President. His policies tackle
the economy, jobs and labor, democracy reform, governance, civil rights,
criminal justice, healthcare, education, family cohesion, foreign policy,
immigration, and miscellaneous topics.

For comparison, [Elizabeth Warren's site][warren] lists 5 issues sans specific
solutions. [Bernie Sanders' site][bernie] has slightly more on his site at 25
issues listed.

"*Yang has the most detailed and comprehensive set of policy proposals we
have ever seen at this stage in the campaign.*" &mdash; The Democratic Party
Leadership of Iowa

### "Andrew Yang is the rich Silicon Valley tech candidate."

Andrew Yang is a **non-profit founder and philanthropist** who spent the last
decade **creating thousands of jobs in disadvantaged cities**. His non-profit
organization, [Venture for America][vfa], trained young entrepreneurs
by placing them in diverse startup industries in cities such as Detroit,
Baltimore, Birmingham, Cleveland, Providence, New Orleans, Atlanta, Nashville,
Cincinnati.

[Forbes]: https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2019/08/14/heres-the-net-worth-of-every-2020-presidential-candidate/

Andrew Yang has never been a venture capitalist nor has he spent a significant
amount of time in Silicon Valley. Before Venture for America, he was the CEO of
an education startup based out of NYC, tutoring kids for the SAT.

According to [Forbes], Yang has among the **third lowest net worth** in the
field at $1 million. For comparison, Bernie Sanders has a higher net worth at
$2.5 million. Elizabeth Warren has a net worth for $12 million.

### "Andrew Yang has zero political experience."

[Gallup]: https://news.gallup.com/poll/5392/trust-government.aspx

According to [a poll by Gallup][Gallup], American citizens' trust in the
government to handling the issues of today is at an all-time low. In 2019, 57%
of people responded they have zero trust or not very much trust in career
politicians to solve the problems of today. That sentiment is mirrored
throughout all of our institutions.

Andrew Yang previously attempted to bring up the issues of automation he had
discovered while doing groundwork across the country. Politicians ignored the
issue or stated they were not able to talk about it. According to [the New
Yorker][nyer], Yang's friend in Washington D.C. told him "*D.C. is a town of
followers, not leaders. The only way we in D.C. will do anything about it is if
you create a wave in the rest of the country and bring that wave crashing down
on our heads"*.

While not government experience, Yang has been in various leadership positions.
He spent the last decade leading a [non-profit organization][vfa], training
young entrepreneurs in disadvantaged cities and creating thousands of jobs.
Leading a non-profit requires galvanizing energy around a share vision.

### "Andrew Yang should run for mayor, congress, Senate, or a cabinet seat instead."

Andrew Yang says we are running out of time to get ahead of the impending
wave of automation, AI, and self-driving vehicles. All of the other politicians
ignored or denied the issue of automation and job displacement. No one was
talking about it. He says the list of how he could meaningfully address the
issue started with and ended with running for president.




## The Freedom Dividend


### "The Freedom Dividend would cause rampant inflation."

The federal government recently printed $4 trillion for the bank bailouts in
its quantitative easing program with no inflation. Our plan for the Freedom
Dividend uses mostly money already in the economy. In monetary economics,
leading theory states that inflation is based on changes in the supply of
money. The Freedom Dividend has minimal changes in the supply of money because
it is funded by a Value-added Tax.

It is likely that some companies will increase their prices in response to
people having more buying power, and a VAT would also increase prices
marginally. However, there will still be competition between firms that will
keep prices in check. Over time, technology will continue to decrease the
prices of most goods where it is allowed to do so (e.g., clothing, media,
consumer electronics, etc.). The main inflation we currently experience is in
sectors where automation has not been applied due to government regulation or
inapplicability, education, and healthcare. The real issue isn't the Freedom
Dividend, it's whether technology and automation will be allowed to reduce
prices in different sectors.
