Materials and resources for canvassing your local neighborhood!
We recommend using [VistaPrint](https://vistaprint.com) for low-cost, high
quality, and quick printing services for flyers, business cards, posters, and
sticky notes.

These materials can be handed out to local businesses, to other people, during
tabling events, left in various areas around town. In some cities, it is legal
to post flyers on utility poles, check your local city laws.
