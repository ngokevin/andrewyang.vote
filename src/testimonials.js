    why: '"He is the only candidate trying to think of how to handle the automation future that\'s coming down the line. We have already seen the affects from China doing those jobs, but now as automation takes even more jobs that can\'t be outsourced, we will have MASSIVE unemployment and we need to plan NOW on how to handle that. That\'s why I will vote for him."',

    why: '"I voted Trump last time to avoid what I saw was a bigger evil. I am not voting Trump again. He is even worse than he came off before he got elected. He is in it for himself and to puff up his ego. Nothing has changed for our family since Trump entered office other than price of everything except gas has gone up it seems. I am disabled, and my husband works in food. My income is not enough to survive on much less thrive. And my husband\'s income at $10p/h at 33-/+hrs a week and must keep open availability to get hours isn\'t working. He loves his job. But it is a chain store and the number one complaint from restaurants is consistency of product. Automated kitchens are coming fast. The fancier places will survive but it\'s the chain stores like my husband\'s who will automate to save cost and operate with skeleton crews. What happens to us then. Yang is the only one saying what I\'ve been saying for the last 7 years. The future is now, and we can\'t afford to wait and make a plan tomorrow."',

    why: '"He\'s the only candidate talking about the real issues that are affecting and will be affecting people\'s daily lives - automation and AI displacing human jobs. In order to effectively tackle climate change and other issues, we need to address the mindset of scarcity that is affecting so many Americans (like the 78% that can\'t afford an extra $500 monthly expense). I\'m a conservative but above all else, I\'m a patriot that cares about where my country is headed if the Democrats and Republicans don\'t get their acts together."',

    why: '"I have always considered myself a reasonable conservative. Someone who rarely voted straight down party lines and would always look for opportunities to see compromises. Andrew Yang represents that to me. My biggest problem with most democratic candidates is that I don\'t feel as though they recognize the problems that everyday Americans face. Andrew Yang, I believe, is the only candidate who not only recognizes the problems Americans face, but offers solutions based in today\'s America not solutions from decades past. I will always vote for someone who recognizes the issues over someone who doesn\'t, or manufactures new issues."',

    why: '"I watched Andrew Yang on Joe Rogan\'s Podcast. They way he talked with reason and logic on issues. I loved how well versed he was on economic issues and how they will effect Americans.  I am a Conservative that believes in Climate Change but I think the Democrats have been very narrow on their solutions. Yang being one of the only candidates R or D that supports Nuclear energy makes me think he is forward thinking and isn\'t just pandering to a base. He believes in practical solutions for problems that face the world and the United States. This only means he has my vote and my first ever political donation."',

    why: '"I voted for Donald Trump in 2016 because I felt that I couldn\'t trust Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump was preaching as if he supported populism and "draining the swamp." He failed to live up to both, miserably.\n The two Democratic candidates I am supporting are Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang. (I would also be happy with Elizabeth Warren or Tulsi Gabbard.) I feel that Bernie and Andrew genuinely want to help the average person and have the ideas and willpower to get things done. Mr. Trump has turned his back on me, my family and the entire Rust Belt. He\'s helped to divide this country to where it almost feels beyond repair. I feel genuine guilt for throwing my vote in his direction last time around, and I certainly won\'t make that mistake again."',

The Freedom Dividend (Universal Basic Income) and Value Added Tax that Mr. Yang is proposing is what the nation needs moving into this next industrial revolution of automation and artificial intelligence. Mr. Yang brings fresh, logical solutions to the problems that got Mr. Trump elected. Mr. Yang is the one to bring this nation together and Make America Think Harder."',
