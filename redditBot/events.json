If you already know how to text-bank, that's the go-to. If you haven't done it before and would like to learn how to volunteer and get signed-up for text-banking & volunteering, get on slack, etc, here's your change.\n\nI have a sailboat (technically a yacht, if only just). Since I'm lucky enough to own a boat, I thought it might be a fun place to do some text-banking, and we can turn it into a temporary #yangyacht. We will not be going out sailing, just chill at the dock, enjoy the weather, and do some texting for Yang.\n\nI've got a little grill, so we could cook up some food, and have a beer or two (no drunk dialing!). I'll probably have a few beers and beverages, but not enough for everyone, so if you'd like to eat, please bring something to share. I'm happy to provide paper plates and (compostable) plastic cutlery. Also, I have a dog who will be attending (will not be making phone calls), so if that's an issue for you, please don't come. I like my dog better than you.\n\nMy boat is located in Wilmington, CA, which is in between san pedro and long beach, because I'm too cheap for Marina Del Rey. When you drive there from the 405, it looks like you're going somewhere to be murdered. You're going the right way, once you get to the marina, it's nice. Just to accurately set expectations, here is a picture of my boat so you don't get too excited: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsBtpnN3uiiNg_B_8HJrt0tHCf7GKg\n\nBy coming to this event you agree to: - wave any liability claims while on the boat. (If you do something dumb like fall in, I'll try to jump in and get you, but I don't want to get sued.) - clean up after yourself, and be responsible for making sure you do not get any trash in the water - be polite to any other boat owners - the owners of the boat next to me live aboard, and they're nice. I don't want to get on their nerves.","timeslots":[{"end_date":1571612400,"is_full":false,"start_date":1571598000,"id":760881}],"accessibility_notes":null,"event_type":"MEETING","modified_date":1571101960,"event_campaign":null,"summary":"","accessibility_status":"NOT_ACCESSIBLE","sponsor":{"is_coordinated":true,"name":"Yang2020","is_independent":false,"candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","modified_date":1571324771,"district":"","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","slug":"yang2020","race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","is_primary_campaign":true,"state":"","org_type":"CAMPAIGN","created_date":1554388751,"id":1396},"high_priority":false,"posted":true},"140892":{"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/140892/","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/organization/190503_seattle-2_20190904205718665386.jpg","visibility":"PUBLIC","virtual_action_url":null,"timezone":"America/New_York","location":{"venue":"Wamesit Lanes","address_lines":["434 Main St",""],"locality":"Tewksbury","region":"MA","country":"US","postal_code":"01876","location":{"latitude":42.6211565,"longitude":-71.2578566},"congressional_district":"6","state_leg_district":"19TH MIDDLESEX","state_senate_district":"SECOND ESSEX & MIDDLESEX"},"contact":null,"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","created_by_volunteer_host":true,"tags":[],"created_date":1571102036,"id":140892,"title":"Tewkesbury Yang Gang Hang at Wamesit Lanes","description":"Come for a meet and greet of fellow Yang Gang members at Wamesit Lanes in Tewkesbury!
