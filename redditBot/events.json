I've decided to partner up again with Baltimore Food not Bombs the weekend before Thanksgiving. Baltimore Food Not Bombs is an organization that 3 times a week they prepare food in mass quantities in a kitchen, then go out to street corners in Baltimore to feed the homeless.  You can find out more about Baltimore Food Not Bombs at https://www.facebook.com/BmoreFNB/\n  \n The purpose of Humanity First Days is to introduce the Yang Gang to local communities, as well as get some media attention.  Be sure to WEAR YANG MERCHANDISE AT THIS EVENT, like a Yang t-shirt, pin, etc.  If you do not have any Yang gear, I can lend you a Yang button for you to wear.  If you plan on serving food, it will most likely be cold outside.  Be sure to wear you Yang button, scarf, MATH beanie, or Yang sweater.\n  \n  The day will consist of 2 parts:\n  \n  from around 11am to 2pm, Food Not Bombs members will meet at the Baltimore Free Farm (3511 Ash St Baltimore MD) to prepare and cook food in the kitchen.\n  \n  from 2 to 4pm, volunteers will transport the food and folding tables from the Baltimore Free Farm to Pennsylvania Ave/North Ave to feed food to the homeless.  We will need people with cars to help transport the food.","timeslots":[{"id":783344,"end_date":1574629200,"start_date":1574611200,"is_full":false}],"high_priority":false,"event_campaign":null,"modified_date":1571770321},"145008":{"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","id":145008,"virtual_action_url":null,"visibility":"PUBLIC","sponsor":{"district":"","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","created_date":1554388751,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","id":1396,"is_coordinated":true,"slug":"yang2020","name":"Yang2020","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","is_primary_campaign":true,"is_independent":false,"state":"","modified_date":1571684394,"race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL"},"location":{"venue":"","address_lines":["5332 S Woodlawn Ave",""],"locality":"Chicago","region":"IL","country":"US","postal_code":"60615","location":{"latitude":41.79845,"longitude":-87.5969846},"congressional_district":"1","state_leg_district":"25","state_senate_district":"13"},"tags":[],"event_type":"DEBATE_WATCH_PARTY","title":"Southside Chicago Yang Watch Party!","accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","contact":null,"timezone":"America/Chicago","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/organization/190514_new%20york-10_20190904205709508784.jpg","created_date":1571774117,"summary":"","accessibility_notes":"The location requires making it up 2 different flights of 5 stairs","browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/145008/","created_by_volunteer_host":true,"description":"Come watch the democratic debate with some massive Yang supporters!","timeslots":[{"id":785042,"end_date":1574307000,"start_date":1574298000,"is_full":false}],"high_priority":false,"event_campaign":null,"modified_date":1571780683,"posted":true},"146241":{"event_type":"FUNDRAISER","created_date":1571943279,"description":"A comedy fundraiser for Andrew Yang!\n\nLineup TBA.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1366921473484613/","created_by_volunteer_host":true,"title":"[LA, CA] Comedy Fundraiser for Yang","summary":"","tags":[],"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/146241/","location":{"venue":"Ethos Society Koreatown","address_lines":["3435 Wilshire Blvd 14th Floor",""],"locality":"Los Angeles","region":"CA","country":"US","postal_code":"90010","location":{"latitude":34.0622655,"longitude":-118.298496},"congressional_district":"34","state_leg_district":"53","state_senate_district":"24"},"timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","high_priority":false,"event_campaign":null,"timeslots":[{"start_date":1575869400,"end_date":1575871200,"is_full":false,"id":790300}],"modified_date":1571952093,"contact":null,"accessibility_notes":null,"virtual_action_url":null,"sponsor":{"is_independent":false,"name":"Yang2020","state":"","created_date":1554388751,"modified_date":1571684394,"district":"","slug":"yang2020","is_coordinated":true,"candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","is_primary_campaign":true,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","id":1396,"race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL"},"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/organization/190503_seattle-2_20190904205718665386.jpg","visibility":"PUBLIC","accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","id":146241},"146267":{"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","id":146267,"virtual_action_url":null,"visibility":"PUBLIC","sponsor":{"district":"","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","created_date":1554388751,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","id":1396,"is_coordinated":true,"slug":"yang2020","name":"Yang2020","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","is_primary_campaign":true,"is_independent":false,"state":"","modified_date":1571684394,"race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL"},"location":{"venue":"The Good Kind Southtown","address_lines":["1127 S St Mary's St",""],"locality":"San Antonio","region":"TX","country":"US","postal_code":"78210","location":{"latitude":29.411844,"longitude":-98.488558},"congressional_district":"35","state_leg_district":"123","state_senate_district":"26"},"tags":[],"event_type":"DEBATE_WATCH_PARTY","title":"San Antonio, TX Democratic Debate Watch and Social","accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","contact":null,"timezone":"America/Chicago","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/organization/190503_seattle-3_20190904205701334648.jpg","created_date":1571944977,"summary":"","accessibility_notes":null,"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/146267/","created_by_volunteer_host":true,"description":"We had a great turn out for the October debates that San Antonio Yang Gang is teaming up once again with The Good Kind - Southtown for the November debate!\n\nBring your friends & family, maybe your dogs too!

Let's meet at the downtown Farmer's Market at 10 am this Saturday to tell others about Andrew Yang! I recommend parking in Locust Street Parking garage. Let's start by meeting in the Pearl coffee shop to gather at 10 then we can walk out to the farmer's market together around 10:20. Please wear your Yang Gang gear (shirts, MATH hat, pins, anything with YANG on it!) and bring your Yang cards to hand out or anything that may help tell others about Yang. The Farmer's market is most packed from 10-12 so I think that should give us plenty of time to talk to lots of folks.

Have you moved from happy supporter to wanting to volunteer virtually and/or physically? This meeting is for you! This meeting will go over the basics of what you can do to be an engaged volunteer. The MA Yang Gang Operations Team will share our internal goals for the next four months as well as give tutorials on how to stay connected, essentials on phone/text-banking and canvassing, event hosting, and other ways to get Andrew to the White House. The NH and MA primaries are less than 3 months away, so join us and learn how to help us win this election and Make America Think Harder.","timeslots":[{"id":839792,"end_date":1574544600,"start_date":1574535600,"is_full":false}],"high_priority":false,"event_campaign":null,"modified_date":1573442918},"155710":{"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","id":155710,"virtual_action_url":null,"visibility":"PUBLIC","sponsor":{"district":"","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","created_date":1554388751,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","id":1396,"is_coordinated":true,"slug":"yang2020","name":"Yang2020","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","is_primary_campaign":true,"is_independent":false,"state":"","modified_date":1571684394,"race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL"},"location":{"venue":"Barnes & Noble","address_lines":["1251 U.S. 31 N",""],"locality":"Greenwood","region":"IN","country":"US","postal_code":"46142","location":{"latitude":39.6326689,"longitude":-86.1206172},"congressional_district":"9","state_leg_district":"58","state_senate_district":"41"},"tags":[],"event_type":"MEETING","title":"Greenwood Yang Gang meet-up!","accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","contact":null,"timezone":"America/New_York","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/event/Yang%20DC_20190513172851134239.jpg","created_date":1573441804,"summary":"","accessibility_notes":null,"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/155710/","created_by_volunteer_host":true,"description":"Hello Yang Gang! \n\nCome meet up with me inside Greenwood Barns N Noble at the Starbuck.
