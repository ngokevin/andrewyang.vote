I've decided to partner up again with Baltimore Food not Bombs the weekend before Thanksgiving. Baltimore Food Not Bombs is an organization that 3 times a week they prepare food in mass quantities in a kitchen, then go out to street corners in Baltimore to feed the homeless.  You can find out more about Baltimore Food Not Bombs at https://www.facebook.com/BmoreFNB/\n  \n The purpose of Humanity First Days is to introduce the Yang Gang to local communities, as well as get some media attention.  Be sure to WEAR YANG MERCHANDISE AT THIS EVENT, like a Yang t-shirt, pin, etc.  If you do not have any Yang gear, I can lend you a Yang button for you to wear.  If you plan on serving food, it will most likely be cold outside.  Be sure to wear you Yang button, scarf, MATH beanie, or Yang sweater.\n  \n  The day will consist of 2 parts:\n  \n  from around 11am to 2pm, Food Not Bombs members will meet at the Baltimore Free Farm (3511 Ash St Baltimore MD) to prepare and cook food in the kitchen.\n  \n  from 2 to 4pm, volunteers will transport the food and folding tables from the Baltimore Free Farm to Pennsylvania Ave/North Ave to feed food to the homeless.

To showcase #HumanityFirst nationwide, Yangsgiving days of service are being planned everywhere, and this is DC’s event!  Food & Friends is a DC-based non-profit that delivers nutritious, tailored meals and/or groceries to our neighbors in need.  They allow political volunteers, so please feel free to wear your Yang gear.  It’s in the NE quadrant near Fort Totten Metro.  Normally we could volunteer as a group, but unfortunately, they are only taking individual volunteers for Thanksgiving.  We could still end up on the same shift, though!\n \nDuring Thanksgiving Week, they are looking for volunteers to drive their own cars to deliver meals to 1-2 families on Thanksgiving Day (AM).  Shifts will be at 8AM, 9AM, 10AM, and 11AM.  You show up on the hour and get a 15 minute orientation.  Then, you’re good to go deliver Thanksgiving meals!  I plan on volunteering to deliver meals with my kids (no age limit to be a passenger). \n \nThey are also looking for kitchen prep volunteers for the following shift hours from Monday through Wednesday (more needed on Monday and Tuesday than Wednesday): 8-10AM, 9-12PM, 1-3PM.  You have to be 14 years and up to volunteer in the kitchen.\n \nIn order to volunteer, you have to pass a background check, which will take 3-5 days to clear, so please sign up within the next few days to be sure you can volunteer!\n\nhttps://foodandfriends.org/volunteer/thanksgiving/how-to-register-for-thanksgiving/","location":{"venue":"Food & Friends","address_lines":["219 Riggs Rd NE",""],"locality":"Washington","region":"DC","country":"US","postal_code":"20011","location":{"latitude":38.9556534,"longitude":-77.0021964},"congressional_district":"98","state_leg_district":null,"state_senate_district":"5"},"event_type":"COMMUNITY","accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","posted":true},"159615":{"created_by_volunteer_host":true,"timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","tags":[],"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","id":159615,"modified_date":1573914324,"title":"Alhambra, CA - Overpass Yanging I-10 Near New Ave","event_campaign":null,"accessibility_notes":null,"visibility":"PUBLIC","browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/159615/","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/event/Yang%20DC_20190513172851134239.jpg","created_date":1573913795,"high_priority":false,"summary":"","timeslots":[{"end_date":1574560800,"id":855026,"start_date":1574550000,"is_full":false}],"virtual_action_url":null,"contact":null,"sponsor":{"created_date":1554388751,"race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","is_primary_campaign":true,"district":"","name":"Yang2020","id":1396,"state":"","modified_date":1573845984,"is_coordinated":true,"event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","is_independent":false,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","slug":"yang2020"},"description":"Hello San Gabriel Valley #YangGang!!!\n\nWe will be inviting Los Angeleneos to \"honk for Yang\" to get his name out there in the city.

It's the first state to vote in the Democratic primaries on February 3rd. It is historically known for it's importance in setting the tone for the rest of the campaign. Yang got the least amount of questions and speaking time in the debate last night. This specific event is to show public enthusiasm and boots on the ground support for the campaign.\nIf you are only able to make the rally at 2pm, it makes all the difference, thank you.\n\n****The campaign is opening two new offices in Iowa this Saturday, Nov. 23rd.****\n-One in Council Bluffs, Iowa at 10am. Afterwards, Andrew himself will canvass.\n-At 2pm, There will be a rally. This is the most important. High attendance needed.\n-Second office opening will be 2 hours North in Sioux City, Iowa at 7pm.\n-After the opening there will be an after party for the Yang Gang at around 8pm.\n-Andrew Yang will for sure be at the first three events and maybe the fourth.\n\nWe have one full car of 4 going currently. We will leave from KC no later than 6am. It is scheduled as a day trip and we will attend all the events and drive back the same day (may change). Desperately need another volunteer vehicle for additional carpool but only the rally attendance at 2pm is required. The office openings and after party are completely optional but would encourage attendance to all of course.
