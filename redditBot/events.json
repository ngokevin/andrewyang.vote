Getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we grow and help Andrew win. The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community and talk about what drew us to the campaign. We can also talk about the ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, and knocking on doors!\nThis should be a really informal meeting! Don’t feel obligated to prepare anything beforehand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic primary beginning in February.","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/organization/190514_new%20york-10_20190904205709508784.jpg","summary":"Sunday morning coffee ☕️","created_by_volunteer_host":true,"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/136883/","event_type":"MEETING","accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","visibility":"PUBLIC","sponsor":{"is_coordinated":true,"modified_date":1571324771,"created_date":1554388751,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","is_primary_campaign":true,"race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","slug":"yang2020","district":"","name":"Yang2020","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","is_independent":false,"state":"","id":1396},"timeslots":[{"end_date":1571601600,"is_full":false,"start_date":1571594400,"id":746970}],"high_priority":false,"timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","tags":[],"title":"Yang Gang Hang - Menlo Park and Surrounding Area","contact":null,"id":136883,"posted":true},"136930":{"modified_date":1570616427,"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","created_date":1570609469,"virtual_action_url":null,"event_campaign":null,"accessibility_notes":null,"location":{"venue":"","address_lines":["1201 Ala Moana Blvd",""],"locality":"Honolulu","region":"HI","country":"US","postal_code":"96814","location":{"latitude":21.2901851,"longitude":-157.8476658},"congressional_district":"1","state_leg_district":"22","state_senate_district":"12"},"description":"Join the Hawaii (Oahu) Yang Gang as we participate in the Honolulu Pride Parade on Saturday, October 19, 2019!

Then take a clipboard and your petition form to a busy location in your community - one great option is a farmers’ market.\nWhen collecting signatures, make sure you encourage people to write legibly. The cleaner our petition forms are, the higher the likelihood of signatures being accepted.\nSignatures must be collected on a form for the County that the signer is registered / eligible to vote in.

If you already know how to text-bank, that's the go-to. If you haven't done it before and would like to learn how to volunteer and get signed-up for text-banking & volunteering, get on slack, etc, here's your change.\n\nI have a sailboat (technically a yacht, if only just). Since I'm lucky enough to own a boat, I thought it might be a fun place to do some text-banking, and we can turn it into a temporary #yangyacht. We will not be going out sailing, just chill at the dock, enjoy the weather, and do some texting for Yang.\n\nI've got a little grill, so we could cook up some food, and have a beer or two (no drunk dialing!). I'll probably have a few beers and beverages, but not enough for everyone, so if you'd like to eat, please bring something to share. I'm happy to provide paper plates and (compostable) plastic cutlery. Also, I have a dog who will be attending (will not be making phone calls), so if that's an issue for you, please don't come. I like my dog better than you.\n\nMy boat is located in Wilmington, CA, which is in between san pedro and long beach, because I'm too cheap for Marina Del Rey. When you drive there from the 405, it looks like you're going somewhere to be murdered. You're going the right way, once you get to the marina, it's nice. Just to accurately set expectations, here is a picture of my boat so you don't get too excited: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsBtpnN3uiiNg_B_8HJrt0tHCf7GKg\n\nBy coming to this event you agree to: - wave any liability claims while on the boat. (If you do something dumb like fall in, I'll try to jump in and get you, but I don't want to get sued.) - clean up after yourself, and be responsible for making sure you do not get any trash in the water - be polite to any other boat owners - the owners of the boat next to me live aboard, and they're nice. I don't want to get on their nerves.","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/organization/190503_seattle-2_20190904205718665386.jpg","summary":"","created_by_volunteer_host":true,"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/140882/","event_type":"MEETING","accessibility_status":"NOT_ACCESSIBLE","visibility":"PUBLIC","sponsor":{"is_coordinated":true,"modified_date":1571324771,"created_date":1554388751,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","is_primary_campaign":true,"race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","slug":"yang2020","district":"","name":"Yang2020","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","is_independent":false,"state":"","id":1396},"timeslots":[{"end_date":1571612400,"is_full":false,"start_date":1571598000,"id":760881}],"high_priority":false,"timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","tags":[],"title":"Los Angeles Yang Hang on the Yang Yacht","contact":null,"id":140882,"posted":true},"140892":{"modified_date":1571102219,"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","created_date":1571102036,"virtual_action_url":null,"event_campaign":null,"accessibility_notes":null,"location":{"venue":"Wamesit Lanes","address_lines":["434 Main St",""],"locality":"Tewksbury","region":"MA","country":"US","postal_code":"01876","location":{"latitude":42.6211565,"longitude":-71.2578566},"congressional_district":"6","state_leg_district":"19TH MIDDLESEX","state_senate_district":"SECOND ESSEX & MIDDLESEX"},"description":"Come for a meet and greet of fellow Yang Gang members at Wamesit Lanes in Tewkesbury!

We will be focusing on how Andrew's policies would impact cannabis legalization and all other aspects of our Humanity First campaign.\n\nEvent Description: \nThe Harvest Cup is the premier New England cannabis competition, culminating with an expo featuring speakers, demonstrations, vendors and the reveal of all the winners. New England is now green with all states supplying medical marijuana to patients and THREE with legal cannabis. It’s time to show other regions that our growers and producers know a thing or two about cannabis.","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/event/Yang%20DC_20190513172851134239.jpg","summary":"","created_by_volunteer_host":true,"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/142732/","event_type":"COMMUNITY","accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","visibility":"PUBLIC","sponsor":{"is_coordinated":true,"modified_date":1571324771,"created_date":1554388751,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","is_primary_campaign":true,"race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","slug":"yang2020","district":"","name":"Yang2020","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","is_independent":false,"state":"","id":1396},"timeslots":[{"end_date":1573423200,"is_full":false,"start_date":1573398000,"id":770864}],"high_priority":false,"timezone":"America/New_York","tags":[],"title":"Worcester MA Community Event at The Harvest Cup Day II","contact":null,"id":142732},"142735":{"modified_date":1571349725,"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","created_date":1571348886,"virtual_action_url":null,"event_campaign":null,"accessibility_notes":null,"location":{"venue":"","address_lines":["North Glenwood Avenue & West Morse Avenue",""],"locality":"Chicago","region":"IL","country":"US","postal_code":"60626","location":{"latitude":42.007907,"longitude":-87.6657481},"congressional_district":"9","state_leg_district":"14","state_senate_district":"7"},"description":"Join the Chicago Yang Gang at the Glenwood Farmers Market to collect signatures for Yang!
