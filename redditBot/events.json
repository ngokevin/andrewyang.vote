I wanted to get started at 6:15 to catch the early birds as well. That’s only about an hour to Yang hundreds of riders. The more of us there, and the earlier we start, the more people we can get to :)\n\nI will be at the starting line (coordinates below) wearing a neon pink cap to provide everyone with cards to hand out. Should be hard to miss, but I’ll be checking my messages just in case. Make sure to wear your Yang merch!!!\n\nIf you would like to participate in the event after the Yanging, feel free to do so.
