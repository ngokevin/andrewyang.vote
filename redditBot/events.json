He spent a long period in isolation, living in a rented residence in Jamaica with no telephone, composing the book.It later lapsed out of print until Beacon Press published an expanded edition in 2010, which featured a new introduction passage by King's long-time friend Vincent Gordon Harding and a foreword by King's wife, Coretta Scott King. The book received critical acclaim, its revamped version being highlighted as a 2011 University Press Book for Public and Secondary School Libraries and recommended for use in teaching.","contact":null,"tags":[],"timezone":"America/New_York","created_date":1576636688,"accessibility_notes":null,"visibility":"PUBLIC","browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/177104/","modified_date":1576637687,"virtual_action_url":null,"event_type":"MEETING","title":"GNV, FL - Community Read - MLK's \"Where Do We Go From Here\"","event_campaign":null,"summary":"","sponsor":{"state":"","name":"Yang2020","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","slug":"yang2020","is_coordinated":true,"race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","created_date":1554388751,"is_independent":false,"id":1396,"event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","is_primary_campaign":true,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","district":"","modified_date":1577995500},"created_by_volunteer_host":true,"timeslots":[{"start_date":1579564800,"id":948970,"is_full":false,"end_date":1579572000}],"id":177104,"featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/organization/190514_new%20york-10_20190904205709508784.jpg","posted":true},"178855":{"high_priority":false,"location":{"venue":"West Des Moines Field Office","address_lines":["950 Office Park Rd 125",""],"locality":"West Des Moines","region":"IA","country":"US","postal_code":"50265","location":{"latitude":41.5893386,"longitude":-93.7162014},"congressional_district":"3","state_leg_district":"42","state_senate_district":"21"},"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","accessibility_status":"ACCESSIBLE","description":"What up, Yang Gang! \n \nJoin us to knock on doors for Andrew Yang.

San Antonio is home to the largest MLK March in the Nation and this year the MLK, Jr. Commission is expecting approximately 300,000 participants!\n We'll meet at the Martin Luther King Academy for Arts Integration at 3501 Martin Luther King Dr, San Antonio, TX 78220\n\n(This event will be updated and include more event day details as we get closer to the event)\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. March Activities:\n\n8:45 - 9:10 AM -- Freeman Coliseum Park and Ride to March\n10:00 AM -- March in the 30th Annual MLK, Jr. March\n\nWe’re excited and proud that Yang Gang will be part of such an incredible event like this year’s MLK March.  Many of us have participated in the March before, however this year is different.  This year we will get to walk in remembrance of Dr. King, his legacy and the progress he’s inspired while also walking for and representing Andew Yang, the rising Democratic Presidential Candidate and outspoken proponent of Dr. King’s legacy and ideas.  This year you can join us in walking and showing support for a Presidential Candidate that is running on the ideas that Martin Luther King, Jr. preached throughout his life, including eradicating poverty, alleviating vast economic disparities in our nation and promoting the importance of the value of each individual as a human and not a number in the economy.  \n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. is an American Hero that was a champion in fighting for American Civil Rights and Equality.  He’s a great leader in our history that found himself in circumstances where he can make a difference for our country, for millions of his fellow Americans and the generations to come.  He ended up dedicating his life to the opportunity of changing the status of his fellow Americans up until the day he was killed while traveling the country promoting the idea of a Universal Basic Income.  This base level income would be given to all Americans with the effect of allowing every American a meaningful chance to participate in our capitalist economy.\n\n\nThe obvious equalizing effects of a Universal Basic Income and the need to overcome historic disparities in our great nation has never gone away, and so today we are proud that Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang is courageous enough to run for president on a platform of the Freedom Dividend, calling again as Dr. King did, for a Universal Basic Income for all Americans that will uplift our entire nation, but especially the impoverished, and those historically and currently left behind by our winner-take-all economy.  Andrew, who is not a career politician, has also found himself situated in a position where he is able to understand the major problems that are affecting our country and the American people, and he has chosen to act on his position and do something to help.  Andrew Yang realizes, similar to Dr. King, that he has the opportunity, and thus the responsibility to take action where he knows that he can make a major difference in the lives of millions of Americans.\n\nWe feel that Dr. King would be proud of the fight that Andrew Yang fighting and the direction he wants to take our country.\n\nFor these reasons we think it will be a great Honor to Dr. King to March for Andrew Yang with the Yang Gang in this years Martin Luther King, Jr. March in San Antonio.\n\nWe really hope you can make it!\n\nPlease contact us with any questions or concerns.\nThank you for your time!","created_by_volunteer_host":true,"summary":"","created_date":1578154581,"virtual_action_url":null,"sponsor":{"name":"Yang2020","org_type":"CAMPAIGN","slug":"yang2020","is_primary_campaign":true,"created_date":1554388751,"modified_date":1577995500,"race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","is_independent":false,"candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","is_coordinated":true,"id":1396,"state":"","district":""},"title":"SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS - MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Local experts on Nuclear energy  want to help share their knowledge and excited that Andrew has included this piece in the climate change discussion.\n\nCome have a discussion about the prospects of atomic energy as a tool to help mitigate climate change. The USA generated 4.2 billion megawatt-hours of clean-air, low-carbon electricity by splitting atoms in 2018, making up 19% of the USA's total electricity. Yet, this energy source is controversial and hotly debated. Its low-carbon nature is inspiring many young scientists and engineers to enter the field, and is causing many environmentalists to reconsider their positions on it in the face of the potential consequences of climate change.\n\nWe will be featuring a local advanced reactor designer and founder of whatisnuclear.com (Nick Touran, Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering from the University of Michigan) and an ecopragmatist from the Seattle Ecomodernist Society (Karl Pauls).

Calling early state voters is one of the most impactful thing we can be doing right now to help Andrew get elected. We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.\n\nFollow the steps below to get started:\n\n1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/). \n\n2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer is usually open from 11:00AM CT to 8:00PM CT. Occasionally, it is open for longer, give or take an hour or two. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 3:00PM CT - 7:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.\n\n4. Once in the Yang 2020 Slack, go to the #callers_start_here channel where Calling Support will be able to answer any questions you have!\n\n![yang_cheer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kd_m4xmF78l3C6WnQ-goN0pcYHgk4dUVW1f217d2MPTo0vmTbkev_EEya1x0lXz3G5Pi3rLMAFPnsPMt0c_6jn2lgnqjRai4YBGOXs49uE1ptoHUYGJa2MyPSGmY0F6o1STB-q2V6KPYilkq0pKyn6lYz7ZYcv9edXAvzs2X1VdDwDF0DHak88-_sDPXsyKMzJa0tnRoWeNvZiwWsxo2SUG3gMWEjl17BvbjCgg4gQLaodmJSxjkXuk-KVcAdeqVEqhO-NEMLsdHPXwYsaywT15c8834_O2uo2ekbliCRekv8plIfOudk6zdZyq17OGAtp-WjeIc1Yc611ZFhwWM3e9AtidZVPSnuD6J5uEQgBbY2bXkqh6Vu3qFKwM9pRps9ty_MWFv5L_57rjp3iQ-uK8Y05iI-3Ogii9quEDX6N4-JjSV6M-7iKl6lBMb7GtVG7obw8PfcpkUsmt3rYXA_SBV5n8H1vfAngeBwFq4u45VRpj7Huib0hAHBI8MGMRMNooanALPQUqEu6RGCHTbfgVZae2EXElRbMIFUepG4cV0Dr4Hmqr66lcyk4qyO8kWncHIPAqam7aAQdivnd4g8vbYonJuwiXPQZS8hgaZaRlEXKdkzZ9DGxahO7qQuzmRDkmwg6jcbsPin3Cr8Hjh5tV_T6ZjDsJKAjfndQ9oFqaiKHf2GOc6s4k=w150-h220-no)","created_by_volunteer_host":false,"summary":"Phone Bank from Anywhere TODAY","created_date":1578505314,"virtual_action_url":"https://www.yang2020.com/call/","sponsor":{"name":"Yang2020","org_type":"CAMPAIGN","slug":"yang2020","is_primary_campaign":true,"created_date":1554388751,"modified_date":1577995500,"race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","is_independent":false,"candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","is_coordinated":true,"id":1396,"state":"","district":""},"title":"📞 Call for Yang! ☎️","tags":[],"location":null},"195062":{"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","timeslots":[{"start_date":1581033600,"end_date":1581040800,"is_full":false,"id":1041268}],"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/195062/","modified_date":1578519150,"accessibility_notes":null,"accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","visibility":"PUBLIC","high_priority":false,"event_campaign":null,"id":195062,"timezone":"America/New_York","event_type":"COMMUNITY","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/event/Yang%20DC_20190513172851134239.jpg","contact":null,"description":"My neighborhood bar is hosting a Mario Kart 64 Tournament (one of my favorite games).

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track.
