They allow political volunteers, so please feel free to wear your Yang gear.  It’s in the NE quadrant near Fort Totten Metro.

We could still end up on the same shift, though!\n \nDuring Thanksgiving Week, they are looking for volunteers to drive their own cars to deliver meals to 1-2 families on Thanksgiving Day (AM).  Shifts will be at 8AM, 9AM, 10AM, and 11AM.  You show up on the hour and get a 15 minute orientation.  Then, you’re good to go deliver Thanksgiving meals!  I plan on volunteering to deliver meals with my kids (no age limit to be a passenger). \n \nThey are also looking for kitchen prep volunteers for the following shift hours from Monday through Wednesday (more needed on Monday and Tuesday than Wednesday): 8-10AM, 9-12PM, 1-3PM.  You have to be 14 years and up to volunteer in the kitchen.\n \nIn order to volunteer, you have to pass a background check, which will take 3-5 days to clear, so please sign up within the next few days to be sure you can volunteer!\n\nhttps://foodandfriends.org/volunteer/thanksgiving/how-to-register-for-thanksgiving/","id":159577,"posted":true},"159661":{"title":"Easley, SC - Yang Gang Hang!","accessibility_notes":"Ninja Warrior faces Highway 93 in the large white building next to Little Caesar's.","created_date":1573924397,"summary":"","modified_date":1573927838,"timeslots":[{"start_date":1575588600,"end_date":1575592200,"id":855086,"is_full":false}],"tags":[],"virtual_action_url":null,"visibility":"PUBLIC","event_type":"MEETING","accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","high_priority":false,"timezone":"America/New_York","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/organization/190503_seattle-3_20190904205701334648.jpg","event_campaign":null,"location":{"venue":"Ninja Warrior Coffee","address_lines":["1954 E Main St",""],"locality":"Easley","region":"SC","country":"US","postal_code":"29640","location":{"latitude":34.8267975,"longitude":-82.5682608},"congressional_district":"3","state_leg_district":"5","state_senate_district":"2"},"contact":null,"created_by_volunteer_host":true,"sponsor":{"name":"Yang2020","created_date":1554388751,"is_primary_campaign":true,"modified_date":1573845984,"slug":"yang2020","is_coordinated":true,"state":"","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","is_independent":false,"district":"","race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","org_type":"CAMPAIGN","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","id":1396},"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/159661/","description":"Thanks for signing up to attend this Yang Gang Hang!
