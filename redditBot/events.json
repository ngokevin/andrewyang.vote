The first step is for us to meet each other. We can meet at McDonald's the Saturday after the October debate for lunch. The goal of this event is for us to get to know each other, talk about why we support Andrew Yang and possibly the debate, and then about how we plan on spreading awareness across campus. I look forward to meeting you all. #yanggang","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/organization/190423_LA-7_20190904205727505425.jpg","sponsor":{"modified_date":1571324771,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","is_primary_campaign":true,"state":"","created_date":1554388751,"slug":"yang2020","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","id":1396,"name":"Yang2020","race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","district":"","is_coordinated":true,"is_independent":false},"event_type":"MEETING","accessibility_status":"ACCESSIBLE","event_campaign":null,"tags":[]},"139162":{"high_priority":false,"modified_date":1571243062,"virtual_action_url":null,"created_date":1570799801,"visibility":"PUBLIC","contact":null,"id":139162,"location":{"venue":"","address_lines":["114 W Housatonic St",""],"locality":"Pittsfield","region":"MA","country":"US","postal_code":"01201","location":{"latitude":42.444152,"longitude":-73.2607331},"congressional_district":"1","state_leg_district":"3RD BERKSHIRE","state_senate_district":"BERKSHIRE, HAMPSHIRE, FRANKLIN & HAMPDEN"},"summary":"","title":"Berkshire Yang Gang Hang","address_visibility":"PUBLIC","timeslots":[{"id":754830,"is_full":false,"start_date":1571351400,"end_date":1571360400}],"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/139162/","accessibility_notes":null,"created_by_volunteer_host":true,"timezone":"America/New_York","description":"Welcome one and all to this Yang Gang Hang to meet other members of the Berkshire Yang Gang and enjoy some drinks and food whilst discussing Yang's policies and campaign/event ideas.\n\nThis hangout will focus on meeting your fellow supporters and introducing new members to Andrew Yang, the Berkshire Yang Gang, and our goals for our local and national movement~! --If you are curious about Yang, this meet-up is for you! --If you want to learn about, understand, or brainstorm debating his policies, this is for you. --If you want to know how to get involved in volunteering, this is for you! --If you want to collaborate and brainstorm in planning for upcoming events, this is for you!\n\nThis event will take place at Hot Dog Ranch, 114 W Housatonic St, Pittsfield, MA 01201\n\nPlease visit the Facebook event listing for more information: https://www.facebook.com/events/783391832114232/","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/organization/190503_seattle-2_20190904205718665386.jpg","sponsor":{"modified_date":1571324771,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","is_primary_campaign":true,"state":"","created_date":1554388751,"slug":"yang2020","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","id":1396,"name":"Yang2020","race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","district":"","is_coordinated":true,"is_independent":false},"event_type":"MEETING","accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","event_campaign":null,"tags":[]},"139298":{"high_priority":false,"modified_date":1571227107,"virtual_action_url":null,"created_date":1570816118,"visibility":"PUBLIC","contact":null,"id":139298,"location":{"venue":"","address_lines":["736 Lake St",""],"locality":"Oak Park","region":"IL","country":"US","postal_code":"60301","location":{"latitude":41.8888208,"longitude":-87.7942598},"congressional_district":"7","state_leg_district":"78","state_senate_district":"39"},"summary":"","title":"Gather signatures and Canvass - Oak Park, Illinois","address_visibility":"PUBLIC","timeslots":[{"id":755161,"is_full":false,"start_date":1571508000,"end_date":1571518800}],"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/139298/","accessibility_notes":null,"created_by_volunteer_host":true,"timezone":"America/Chicago","description":"Hey guys!

The goal is to meet at 1:00 PM and exchange materials and information with all the volunteers so we can be as prepared as possible. This will also be to provide you with any legal information that may be necessary. As we start getting teams together and moving out, I will give you guys blocks to canvass. We will begin canvassing at 2:00 PM and finish around 4:00 PM. The goal is to cover Oak Park, heading West between Lake Street and Division. If we have more people we can also expand the range.
