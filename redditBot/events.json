You can find out more about Baltimore Food Not Bombs at https://www.facebook.com/BmoreFNB/\n  \n The purpose of Humanity First Days is to introduce the Yang Gang to local communities, as well as get some media attention.  Be sure to WEAR YANG MERCHANDISE AT THIS EVENT, like a Yang t-shirt, pin, etc.  If you do not have any Yang gear, I can lend you a Yang button for you to wear.  If you plan on serving food, it will most likely be cold outside.  Be sure to wear you Yang button, scarf, MATH beanie, or Yang sweater.\n  \n  The day will consist of 2 parts:\n  \n  from around 11am to 2pm, Food Not Bombs members will meet at the Baltimore Free Farm (3511 Ash St Baltimore MD) to prepare and cook food in the kitchen.\n  \n  from 2 to 4pm, volunteers will transport the food and folding tables from the Baltimore Free Farm to Pennsylvania Ave/North Ave to feed food to the homeless.

Weekly Yang Hang Panera Bread 7 PM.\n\nDrop in and meet your friendly Yang Gang. This is for the Yang curious and anyone with an interest in building a grassroots movement to put Andrew Yang in the White House. \n\nIn celebration of Fall we're bringing you both a trick and a treat. Treat yourself to a Yang Hang where we explore everything from how to relax with warm drink to the hot topics of the day and tricks on how to reach your family and friends with the message of #YangGangLove/\n\nGet inspired to learn how to Hustle. Text Banking (Hustle) is our top priority for reaching interested voters.\n\nHere’s Why You Should Text-Bank:\n\n😱I’ve never volunteered before, I’m reluctant to start now... 😱\nDon’t worry! Text banking is a great way to start volunteering because there aren’t any face-to-face interactions, meetings, or phone calls involved. \n\n📱I don’t want to text using my own phone number. 📱\nOur texting platform takes care of everything. We just need your US phone number to get your account set up, we don’t use it to send out texts!\n\n🙊Yang has 100+ policies, I can’t memorize/explain all of them. 🙊\nWe’ve got all the common responses/materials you’ll need! \n\n😡I’m not ready for Youtube comment-style debates over texts. 😡\nWe aren’t either! Our main goal is to identify voters. If they’re genuinely curious about Andrew Yang, we’ll gladly provide them with more information!\n\n😩Text-banking sounds overwhelming since it involves training and software. 😩\nWe’ve updated our training so that it's 100% online and self-paced. We’ve got Welcome Team/Text Support volunteers to help you every step of the way!\n\n⏰I’m too busy to text-bank! ⏰\nWe text-bank every day from 9AM to 9PM (Targeted state time), so you can jump in whenever we’re open. We also have a mobile app, so you can “Yang” people anywhere you have an internet connection! \n\n😵I don’t want to get swamped with replies after I send out lots of texts! 😵\nYou get to decide how many texts you want to send out at a time. From 200 texts on your coffee break to 2000 texts like our average texters, it’s really up to you!","event_campaign":null,"location":{"venue":"Panera Bread","address_lines":["526 E Coliseum Blvd",""],"locality":"Fort Wayne","region":"IN","country":"US","postal_code":"46805","location":{"latitude":41.117775,"longitude":-85.1327988},"congressional_district":"3","state_leg_district":"81","state_senate_district":"15"},"created_by_volunteer_host":true,"tags":[],"accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","title":"Fort Wayne IN - Weekly Yang Hang - Learn How To Hustle"},"152047":{"virtual_action_url":null,"visibility":"PUBLIC","timeslots":[{"id":818089,"is_full":false,"end_date":1573318800,"start_date":1573311600},{"id":818090,"is_full":false,"end_date":1573326000,"start_date":1573318800},{"id":818091,"is_full":false,"end_date":1573412400,"start_date":1573405200},{"id":818092,"is_full":false,"end_date":1573419600,"start_date":1573412400}],"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/152047/","created_date":1572973746,"summary":"","address_visibility":"PUBLIC","timezone":"America/New_York","sponsor":{"modified_date":1570562881,"is_independent":false,"name":"New Hampshire for Yang","race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","created_date":1567536285,"is_primary_campaign":true,"slug":"nhforyang","is_coordinated":true,"id":1835,"state":"NH","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/nhforyang/","district":"","org_type":"CAMPAIGN"},"id":152047,"high_priority":false,"accessibility_notes":"","contact":null,"featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/event/67806444_2500834783302043_684455995564359680_n_20191027193847422628.jpg","event_type":"CANVASS","modified_date":1572973747,"description":"Come join us for our weekend of action canvassing Portsmouth!

If you already know how to text-bank, that's the go-to. If you haven't done it before and would like to learn how to volunteer and get signed-up for text-banking & volunteering, get on slack, etc, here's your chance.\n\nI have a sailboat (technically a yacht, if only just). Since I'm lucky enough to own a boat, I thought it might be a fun place to do some text-banking, and we can turn it into a temporary #yangyacht. We will not be going out sailing, just chill at the dock, enjoy the weather, and do some texting for Yang.\n\nI've got a little grill, so we could cook up some food and have a drink or two (no drunk dialing!). I'll probably have some food and beverages on hand, but not enough for everyone - so if you'd like to eat, please bring something to share. I'm happy to provide paper plates and (compostable) plastic cutlery. Also, I have a dog who will be attending (will not be making phone calls), so if that's an issue for you, please don't come. I like my dog better than you.\n\nMy boat is located in Wilmington, CA, which is in between San Pedro and Long Beach, because I'm too cheap for Marina Del Rey. When you drive there from the 405, it looks like you're going somewhere to be murdered. You're going the right way, once you get to the marina, it's nice. Just to accurately set expectations, here is a picture of my boat so you don't get too excited: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsBtpnN3uiiNg_B_8HJrt0tHCf7GKg\n\nBy coming to this event you agree to: - wave any liability claims while on the boat. (If you do something dumb like fall in, I'll try to jump in and get you, but I don't want to get sued.) - clean up after yourself, and be responsible for making sure you do not get any trash in the water - be polite to any other boat owners - the owners of the boat next to me live aboard, and they're nice. I don't want to get on their nerves.","event_campaign":null,"location":{"venue":"Yacht Haven Marina","address_lines":["720 Peninsula Rd",""],"locality":"Wilmington","region":"CA","country":"US","postal_code":"90744","location":{"latitude":33.7662196,"longitude":-118.2497071},"congressional_district":"44","state_leg_district":"70","state_senate_district":"35"},"created_by_volunteer_host":true,"tags":[],"accessibility_status":"NOT_ACCESSIBLE","title":"Los Angeles, CA Yang Hang: Textbank on the Yang Yacht","posted":true},"152704":{"virtual_action_url":null,"visibility":"PUBLIC","timeslots":[{"id":821834,"is_full":false,"end_date":1575095400,"start_date":1575086400}],"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/152704/","created_date":1573026481,"summary":"","address_visibility":"PUBLIC","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","sponsor":{"modified_date":1571684394,"is_independent":false,"name":"Yang2020","race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","created_date":1554388751,"is_primary_campaign":true,"slug":"yang2020","is_coordinated":true,"id":1396,"state":"","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","district":"","org_type":"CAMPAIGN"},"id":152704,"high_priority":false,"accessibility_notes":null,"contact":null,"featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/event/Yang%20DC_20190513172851134239.jpg","event_type":"COMMUNITY","modified_date":1573043902,"description":"On November 29th the Festival of Lights kicks off with its opening ceremony.
