I've decided to partner up again with Baltimore Food not Bombs the weekend before Thanksgiving. Baltimore Food Not Bombs is an organization that 3 times a week they prepare food in mass quantities in a kitchen, then go out to street corners in Baltimore to feed the homeless.  You can find out more about Baltimore Food Not Bombs at https://www.facebook.com/BmoreFNB/\n  \n The purpose of Humanity First Days is to introduce the Yang Gang to local communities, as well as get some media attention.  Be sure to WEAR YANG MERCHANDISE AT THIS EVENT, like a Yang t-shirt, pin, etc.  If you do not have any Yang gear, I can lend you a Yang button for you to wear.  If you plan on serving food, it will most likely be cold outside.  Be sure to wear you Yang button, scarf, MATH beanie, or Yang sweater.\n  \n  The day will consist of 2 parts:\n  \n  from around 11am to 2pm, Food Not Bombs members will meet at the Baltimore Free Farm (3511 Ash St Baltimore MD) to prepare and cook food in the kitchen.\n  \n  from 2 to 4pm, volunteers will transport the food and folding tables from the Baltimore Free Farm to Pennsylvania Ave/North Ave to feed food to the homeless.

There will be some Yang themed ones, but feel free to create anything. The Trillium Brewery gets quite crowded but I will try to get us a table on the second floor (will update with location and how to find us).\n\nThere will also be some shared apps, but otherwise we'll be responsible for our own food and drinks.
