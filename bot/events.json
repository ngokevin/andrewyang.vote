The USA generated 4.2 billion megawatt-hours of clean-air, low-carbon electricity by splitting atoms in 2018, making up 19% of the USA's total electricity. Yet, this energy source is controversial and hotly debated. Its low-carbon nature is inspiring many young scientists and engineers to enter the field, and is causing many environmentalists to reconsider their positions on it in the face of the potential consequences of climate change.\n\nWe will be featuring a local advanced reactor designer and founder of whatisnuclear.com (Nick Touran, Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering from the University of Michigan) and an ecopragmatist from the Seattle Ecomodernist Society (Karl Pauls). They will present that history, current status, and future prospects of nuclear technology, including details about Thorium fuel as discussed in the Democratic debates by Andrew Yang.

Calling early state voters is one of the most impactful thing we can be doing right now to help Andrew get elected. We truly can't thank you all enough for your support and commitment to this movement.\n\nFollow the steps below to get started:\n\n1. Join our Yang 2020 Slack where you can chat with other callers and ask questions by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://www.yang2020.com/join-volunteer-slack/). \n\n2. Everything you need to know about making calls can be found in our Call Team Handbook which you can check out by [opening this link in a separate tab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xNaWzkv6ZxpU2dQECmDFc8KcTuNj_ZOAXf9yy8jrJM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n3. Sign up for as many shifts as you'd like by filling in your info on the right side of your screen! If something changes with your schedule, don't worry about cancelling. The dialer is usually open from 11:00AM CT to 8:00PM CT. Occasionally, it is open for longer, give or take an hour or two. We're *strongly* encouraging everyone to sign up at \"peak hours\" 3:00PM CT - 7:00PM CT in order to minimize the wait time between calls.\n\n4. Once in the Yang 2020 Slack, go to the #callers_start_here channel where Calling Support will be able to answer any questions you have!\n\n![yang_cheer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kd_m4xmF78l3C6WnQ-goN0pcYHgk4dUVW1f217d2MPTo0vmTbkev_EEya1x0lXz3G5Pi3rLMAFPnsPMt0c_6jn2lgnqjRai4YBGOXs49uE1ptoHUYGJa2MyPSGmY0F6o1STB-q2V6KPYilkq0pKyn6lYz7ZYcv9edXAvzs2X1VdDwDF0DHak88-_sDPXsyKMzJa0tnRoWeNvZiwWsxo2SUG3gMWEjl17BvbjCgg4gQLaodmJSxjkXuk-KVcAdeqVEqhO-NEMLsdHPXwYsaywT15c8834_O2uo2ekbliCRekv8plIfOudk6zdZyq17OGAtp-WjeIc1Yc611ZFhwWM3e9AtidZVPSnuD6J5uEQgBbY2bXkqh6Vu3qFKwM9pRps9ty_MWFv5L_57rjp3iQ-uK8Y05iI-3Ogii9quEDX6N4-JjSV6M-7iKl6lBMb7GtVG7obw8PfcpkUsmt3rYXA_SBV5n8H1vfAngeBwFq4u45VRpj7Huib0hAHBI8MGMRMNooanALPQUqEu6RGCHTbfgVZae2EXElRbMIFUepG4cV0Dr4Hmqr66lcyk4qyO8kWncHIPAqam7aAQdivnd4g8vbYonJuwiXPQZS8hgaZaRlEXKdkzZ9DGxahO7qQuzmRDkmwg6jcbsPin3Cr8Hjh5tV_T6ZjDsJKAjfndQ9oFqaiKHf2GOc6s4k=w150-h220-no)","modified_date":1579205517,"tags":[],"title":"📞 Call for Yang! ☎️","id":194881,"timeslots":[{"start_date":1579798800,"id":1040469,"is_full":false,"end_date":1579831200},{"start_date":1579885200,"id":1040470,"is_full":false,"end_date":1579917600},{"start_date":1579971600,"id":1040471,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580004000},{"start_date":1580058000,"id":1040472,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580090400},{"start_date":1580144400,"id":1040473,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580176800},{"start_date":1580230800,"id":1040474,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580263200},{"start_date":1580317200,"id":1040475,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580349600},{"start_date":1580403600,"id":1040476,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580436000},{"start_date":1580490000,"id":1040477,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580522400},{"start_date":1580576400,"id":1087067,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580608800},{"start_date":1580662800,"id":1087068,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580695200},{"start_date":1580749200,"id":1087069,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580781600},{"start_date":1580835600,"id":1087070,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580868000},{"start_date":1580922000,"id":1087071,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580954400},{"start_date":1581008400,"id":1087072,"is_full":false,"end_date":1581040800},{"start_date":1581094800,"id":1087073,"is_full":false,"end_date":1581127200},{"start_date":1581181200,"id":1087074,"is_full":false,"end_date":1581213600},{"start_date":1581267600,"id":1087075,"is_full":false,"end_date":1581300000},{"start_date":1581354000,"id":1087076,"is_full":false,"end_date":1581386400},{"start_date":1581440400,"id":1087077,"is_full":false,"end_date":1581472800},{"start_date":1581526800,"id":1087078,"is_full":false,"end_date":1581559200},{"start_date":1581613200,"id":1087079,"is_full":false,"end_date":1581645600},{"start_date":1581699600,"id":1087080,"is_full":false,"end_date":1581732000},{"start_date":1581786000,"id":1087081,"is_full":false,"end_date":1581818400},{"start_date":1581872400,"id":1087082,"is_full":false,"end_date":1581904800},{"start_date":1581958800,"id":1087083,"is_full":false,"end_date":1581991200},{"start_date":1582045200,"id":1087084,"is_full":false,"end_date":1582077600},{"start_date":1582131600,"id":1087085,"is_full":false,"end_date":1582164000},{"start_date":1582218000,"id":1087086,"is_full":false,"end_date":1582250400},{"start_date":1582304400,"id":1087087,"is_full":false,"end_date":1582336800},{"start_date":1582390800,"id":1087088,"is_full":false,"end_date":1582423200},{"start_date":1582477200,"id":1087089,"is_full":false,"end_date":1582509600},{"start_date":1582563600,"id":1087090,"is_full":false,"end_date":1582596000},{"start_date":1582650000,"id":1087091,"is_full":false,"end_date":1582682400},{"start_date":1582736400,"id":1087092,"is_full":false,"end_date":1582768800},{"start_date":1582822800,"id":1087093,"is_full":false,"end_date":1582855200},{"start_date":1582909200,"id":1087094,"is_full":false,"end_date":1582941600},{"start_date":1582995600,"id":1087095,"is_full":false,"end_date":1583028000}],"event_type":"PHONE_BANK","visibility":"PUBLIC","summary":"Phone Bank from Anywhere TODAY","contact":null,"featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/event/3x2%20call4yang_20200108180929344339.png","timezone":"America/Chicago","accessibility_status":null},"195062":{"summary":"","created_date":1578514381,"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","title":"Baltimore,  MD - Crowd-Yanging at Mario Kart 64 Tournament","location":{"venue":"Monument City Brewing Company","address_lines":["1 N Haven St",""],"locality":"Baltimore","region":"MD","country":"US","postal_code":"21224","location":{"latitude":39.2925667,"longitude":-76.5621268},"congressional_district":"3","state_leg_district":"46","state_senate_district":"46"},"high_priority":false,"description":"My neighborhood bar is hosting a Mario Kart 64 Tournament (one of my favorite games).

He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve—one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.","modified_date":1579111354,"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"Official campaign event"}],"title":"Dubuque Town Hall with Andrew Yang","id":199208,"timeslots":[{"start_date":1579798800,"id":1066953,"is_full":false,"end_date":1579802400}],"event_type":"TOWN_HALL","visibility":"PUBLIC","summary":"","contact":null,"featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/event/town%20hall%20%281%29_20200112205252695592.jpg","timezone":"America/Chicago","accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","posted":true},"199235":{"accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/organization/190514_new%20york-10_20190904205709508784.jpg","location":{"venue":"Jefferson's Lounge","address_lines":["149 W Broadway",""],"locality":"Council Bluffs","region":"IA","country":"US","postal_code":"51503","location":{"latitude":41.2623077,"longitude":-95.8453166},"congressional_district":"3","state_leg_district":"16","state_senate_district":"8"},"contact":null,"id":199235,"accessibility_notes":null,"created_by_volunteer_host":true,"tags":[],"created_date":1578864356,"summary":"","modified_date":1578864857,"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","title":"COUNCIL BLUFFS, IOWA - YANG GANG HANG","timeslots":[{"id":1067088,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580263200,"start_date":1580256000}],"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/199235/","sponsor":{"is_independent":false,"district":"","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","id":1396,"is_coordinated":true,"created_date":1554388751,"slug":"yang2020","name":"Yang2020","state":"","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","is_primary_campaign":true,"modified_date":1577995500,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN"},"event_campaign":null,"virtual_action_url":null,"high_priority":false,"timezone":"America/Chicago","event_type":"MEETING","description":"Yang Gang Hang in Council Bluffs!

To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve—one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.","modified_date":1579548405,"tags":[{"id":1,"name":"Official campaign event"}],"title":"Andrew Yang Jefferson Town Hall","id":206685,"timeslots":[{"start_date":1580070600,"id":1101057,"is_full":false,"end_date":1580074200}],"event_type":"TOWN_HALL","visibility":"PUBLIC","summary":"","contact":null,"featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/event/DSC01718_20200120192631025475.jpg","timezone":"America/Chicago","accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE"},"206686":{"sponsor":{"slug":"yang2020","race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","district":"","is_independent":false,"modified_date":1577995500,"id":1396,"event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","name":"Yang2020","state":"","is_coordinated":true,"created_date":1554388751,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","is_primary_campaign":true},"accessibility_notes":null,"virtual_action_url":null,"location":{"venue":"Rochester Institute of Technology","address_lines":["1 Lomb Memorial Dr","Grace Watson"],"locality":"Rochester","region":"NY","country":"US","postal_code":"14623","location":{"latitude":43.0844955,"longitude":-77.6749311},"congressional_district":"25","state_leg_district":"138","state_senate_district":"59"},"event_campaign":null,"high_priority":false,"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/206686/","created_date":1579548611,"created_by_volunteer_host":true,"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","description":"RIT's Yang Gang (all are welcome) will be going door-to-door to hand out info about Yang and collect signatures for delegates running in Rochester.
