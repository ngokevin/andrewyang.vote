Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling and yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!\n\nConnecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!\n\nThis is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don’t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.\n\nThis will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!\n\nAnd really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody.

Specifically will be discussing getting things together for phonebanking parties, fundraisers, and the usual tabling and yanging at local events! The cafe isn't the biggest so will be easy to spot. Look for the redhead with the Yanged out laptop!\n\nConnecting through our Facebook group \"Humboldt County Yang Gang\" is great, but getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we can really grow and help Andrew win! The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!\n\nThis is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don’t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.\n\nThis will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!\n\nAnd really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody.

Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve—one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.","visibility":"PUBLIC","browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/202701/","summary":"","id":202701,"tags":[{"name":"Official campaign event","id":1}],"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","contact":null,"event_type":"TOWN_HALL","virtual_action_url":null,"high_priority":true,"location":{"venue":"Green Valley Getaway","address_lines":["78 16th Ave NW",""],"locality":"Waukon","region":"IA","country":"US","postal_code":"52172","location":{"latitude":43.2884948,"longitude":-91.471924},"congressional_district":"1","state_leg_district":"56","state_senate_district":"28"},"accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","accessibility_notes":"","timezone":"America/Chicago","timeslots":[{"is_full":false,"start_date":1579739400,"id":1084608,"end_date":1579743000}],"featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/event/town%20hall%20%281%29_20200116010057530609.jpg","sponsor":{"modified_date":1577995500,"created_date":1554388751,"event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","org_type":"CAMPAIGN","slug":"yang2020","name":"Yang2020","id":1396,"state":"","candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","is_independent":false,"is_primary_campaign":true,"is_coordinated":true,"district":""},"title":"Andrew Yang Town Hall in Allamakee County","event_campaign":null,"city":"Waukon","venue":"Green Valley Getaway","time":"6:30PM","day":"Wednesday 1/22"},{"modified_date":1579473064,"created_date":1579472172,"created_by_volunteer_host":true,"description":"We are opening up the Sorority of Yang House for local and out of town Yang Gang to get together! \n\nCome by and lets figure out how to grow the local Davenport Yang Gang!","visibility":"PUBLIC","browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/205888/","summary":"","id":205888,"tags":[],"address_visibility":"PRIVATE","contact":null,"event_type":"MEETING","virtual_action_url":null,"high_priority":false,"location":{"locality":"Davenport","region":"IA","country":"US","postal_code":"52802","congressional_district":"2","state_leg_district":"90","state_senate_district":"45","address_lines":["This event’s address is private.
