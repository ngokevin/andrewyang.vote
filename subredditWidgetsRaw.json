Don’t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up.

And a non-profit leader.\n\nAndrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.\n\nAndrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve—one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.","contact":null,"timezone":"America/Chicago","event_campaign":null,"sponsor":{"district":"","id":1396,"event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","is_primary_campaign":true,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","modified_date":1577995500,"is_independent":false,"candidate_name":"Andrew
