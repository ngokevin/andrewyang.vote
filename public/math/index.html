its quantitative easing program with no inflation. Our plan for the Freedom
Dividend uses mostly money already in the economy. In monetary economics,
leading theory states that inflation is based on changes in the supply of
money. The Freedom Dividend has minimal changes in the supply of money because
it is funded by a Value-added Tax.</p>
<p>It is likely that some companies will increase their prices in response to
people having more buying power, and a VAT would also increase prices
marginally. However, there will still be competition between firms that will
keep prices in check. Over time, technology will continue to decrease the
prices of most goods where it is allowed to do so (e.g., clothing, media,
consumer electronics, etc.). The main inflation we currently experience is in
sectors where automation has not been applied due to government regulation or
inapplicability, education, and healthcare. The real issue isn’t the Freedom
Dividend, it’s whether technology and automation will be allowed to reduce
prices in different sectors.</p>
