The purpose of this meeting is just to get to know other Yang supporters in our community, talk about what drew us to the campaign, and discuss ways to get Andrew to the White House - making calls, sending texts, knocking on doors, but also fun actions at local community events!\n\nThis is to be a fairly informal meeting. Don’t feel obligated to prepare anything before hand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We just want to start building a Yang Gang presence in our community as we approach the Democratic Primary beginning with that early voting in February.\n\nThis will hopefully be a great place to prepare for canvassing and brainstorm creative ways to make everyone aware of Yang's message. Bring your ideas, and I will bring Yang Cards to share!\n\nAnd really this location is just to start, but we can change it if someone thinks up or can offer a more suitable place -and the time as well if another works better for everybody.

And a non-profit leader.\n\nAndrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.\n\nAndrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve—one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.","contact":null,"location":{"venue":"The Port","address_lines":["5405 Chimra Rd",""],"locality":"Panora","region":"IA","country":"US","postal_code":"50216","location":{"latitude":41.7059606,"longitude":-94.3636991},"congressional_district":"3","state_leg_district":"20","state_senate_district":"10"},"virtual_action_url":null,"event_type":"TOWN_HALL","modified_date":1579548204,"posted":true,"city":"Panora","venue":"The Port","time":"12:30PM","day":"Sunday 1/26","tweeted":{"SFYangGang":{},"bubblepoptarts":{},"OaklandYangGang":{},"BrendonCarpent4":{},"Kev_Pham03":{},"NOLAYangGang":{},"HoustonYangGang":{},"Yang2020Mass":{},"yennijb":{},"nycyanggang":{},"CincyYangGang":{},"vegasyanggang":{}}},{"event_type":"PHONE_BANK","accessibility_notes":"","high_priority":false,"timeslots":[{"is_full":false,"end_date":1580076000,"id":1092057,"start_date":1580065200}],"summary":"Calling all Yang Gang for Call Time","id":204522,"featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/event/YAN00802_20191222013216255880.jpg","browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/204522/","sponsor":{"district":"","race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","slug":"iowaforyang","created_date":1567536160,"is_independent":false,"id":1834,"is_coordinated":true,"modified_date":1578518332,"candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","name":"Iowa for Yang","org_type":"CAMPAIGN","state":"IA","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/iowaforyang/","is_primary_campaign":true},"visibility":"PUBLIC","contact":null,"virtual_action_url":null,"created_by_volunteer_host":false,"accessibility_status":"ACCESSIBLE","created_date":1579297960,"event_campaign":null,"title":"Weekend Phone Bank:","modified_date":1579987354,"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","timezone":"America/Chicago","tags":[],"location":{"venue":"Andrew Yang 2020: Decorah Office","address_lines":["218 West Water Street",""],"locality":"Decorah","region":"IA","country":"US","postal_code":"52101","location":{"latitude":43.30441,"longitude":-91.787987},"congressional_district":"1","state_leg_district":"55","state_senate_district":"28"},"description":"With only a handful of weeks remaining before the Caucus, join the Yang Gang as we continue to build our wave of momentum before it crashes down on Feb. 3 the business as usual system stacked against working class Iowans.\n\nWe have the grassroots energy to win this election, but we can’t let up if we want to rewrite the rules of the 21st century and put Andrew Yang in the White House.

And a non-profit leader.\n\nAndrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.\n\nAndrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve—one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.","contact":null,"timezone":"America/Chicago","event_campaign":null,"sponsor":{"district":"","id":1396,"event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","is_primary_campaign":true,"org_type":"CAMPAIGN","modified_date":1577995500,"is_independent":false,"candidate_name":"Andrew

We will get together on Wednesday, January 29 from 4:30-7:00 to call Iowans.  The purpose of the calls is to find out their interest level in Andrew Yang #1- #5.  The calls should be quick and simple.  The data that we gather is critical for the volunteers in Iowa and the success the campaign will have leading up to and including the caucus on  February 3.  My hope is that we can gather, get the hang of it, and continue to call each night until the Iowa caucus.  By then we should be pros and able to continue calling NH, SC, NV, ....\n\nYou will need the following:\n-Laptop\n-Cell Phone\n-Headphones\n\nPrior to Wednesday:\nGo to Yang2020.com/call to complete the calling pre-steps and learn how the dialer, etc work.\n\nThere will be snacks!!","contact":null,"city":"Kirkland","venue":"This event’s address is private.
