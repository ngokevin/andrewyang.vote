He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track.

Getting supporters together in-real-life (IRL) is how we grow and help Andrew win.

We can also talk about the ways to get Andrew to the White House - Phone banking, Text banking, and knocking on doors! This should be a really informal meeting! Don’t feel obligated to prepare anything beforehand or feel like you need to have prior campaigning experience to show up. We are building a Yang Gang presence in Milwaukee as we approach the Democratic primary beginning in February!
