So let’s knock on every door and make every phone call we can to show our friends and neighbors how a Humanity First national would benefit them.\n\nEvery day our passionate supporters reach out to those in their communities to share Andrew’s plans to create opportunity for every American and ensure our children the future they deserve.\n\nIf you’ve never volunteered before, no worries! Our friendly staff will help catch you up to speed. In fact, many of Andrew Yang’s most ardent volunteers are first time Caucus goers. What matters most is that you realize your own power. In every door knock and every phone call, our movement is one step closer to achieving Andrew’s vision: an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality, for every person.\n\nPlease join us and be a part of that effort. Nothing short of the future of our nation is at stake.\n\nNote: If you do, thank you! Please bring a fully charged cell phone.

RSVP is not required but encouraged.\n\nCome meet Andrew Yang! An Entrepreneur. A husband and father. And a non-profit leader.\n\nAndrew Yang will be hosting multiple town halls and events to engage with Iowans and share his bold plans to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy so they work fairly for everyone, not just corporations.\n\nAndrew's not a career politician. He's a job creator who understands the economy. That is why as president, Andrew's first priority will be to implement the big solutions America needs to get back on track. To start, he'd enact a $1,000 a month Freedom Dividend, no strings attached, for every American 18 and older. Andrew understands that if the rules of our economy don't work for everyone, they don't work. As the father of two young boys, Andrew is committed to doing everything in his power to create the kind of future our children deserve—one with an America of opportunity, freedom, and equality.","contact":null,"location":{"venue":"Fairfield Arts & Convention Center - Sondheim Center for the Performing Arts","address_lines":["200 N Main St",""],"locality":"Fairfield","region":"IA","country":"US","postal_code":"52556","location":{"latitude":41.0090991,"longitude":-91.9642263},"congressional_district":"2","state_leg_district":"82","state_senate_district":"41"},"featured_image_url":"https://mobilizeamerica.imgix.net/uploads/event/town%20hall%20%281%29_20200116230043484508.jpg","summary":"","modified_date":1579714229,"visibility":"PUBLIC","accessibility_status":"NOT_SURE","event_campaign":null,"accessibility_notes":"","high_priority":false,"sponsor":{"race_type":"PRESIDENTIAL","event_feed_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/","slug":"yang2020","is_primary_campaign":true,"name":"Yang2020","created_date":1554388751,"is_coordinated":true,"state":"","district":"","is_independent":false,"id":1396,"modified_date":1577995500,"candidate_name":"Andrew Yang","org_type":"CAMPAIGN"},"created_date":1579215732,"created_by_volunteer_host":false,"id":203490,"browser_url":"https://www.mobilize.us/yang2020/event/203490/","virtual_action_url":null,"timeslots":[{"is_full":false,"id":1087872,"start_date":1579914000,"end_date":1579917600}],"posted":true,"city":"Fairfield","venue":"Fairfield Arts & Convention Center - Sondheim Center for the Performing Arts","time":"7PM","day":"Friday 1/24"}],[{"title":"Yang Gang Hang","tags":[],"address_visibility":"PUBLIC","timezone":"America/Chicago","event_type":"MEETING","description":"Whether you're curious to learn more about Yang or you're all-in #YangGang, come join us for coffee and discussion about the issues that are important to us and how we can use our special power as Iowans to change our future for the better!

We need recruits volunteers for these two events. Each booth needs a minimum of two volunteers, each shift is two hours. Please come and help us promote Andrew Yang!\n\nFor local candidates: you are welcome to bring your materials, your campaign staff/ volunteers to promote yourself,  BUT your volunteers will put into a shift to talk about Andrew.\n\nYang Gang Volunteers and Candidates please respond in the comment that you are coming. I only take 10 first responders who can bring your own volunteers. Since the booth space is limited. More details will be discussed later in a group chat\n\nThank you!
